> The classic game with a fresh coat of paint. Enjoy!

## How to play:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid. The game involves two players, often referred to as "X" and "O," who take turns marking spaces on the grid. In this version, there are simply pink and blue boxes, serving the same purpose. The objective of the game is to create a line of three matching symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.

Here are the rules:

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

2. The first player, pink, takes the first turn. The second player, blue takes the second turn. They will alternate for the remainder of the game

3. During their turn, each player can place their color in any empty cell on the grid.

4. Once a player places their symbol in a cell, they cannot change it.

5. The game continues until one of the following outcomes is reached:
   - A player forms a line of three of their respective color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - All the cells on the grid are filled with symbols, but no player has formed a line of three. In this case, the game ends in a draw or a tie.

6. If a player wins the game, they are declared the winner, and a point is added to their score. They players are then prompted with the opportunity to clear the board and continue playing. If the game ends in a draw, no player gets points.
